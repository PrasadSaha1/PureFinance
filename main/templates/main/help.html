        <p>To use the website, you must make an account. If you are not currently logged in, you can go to the home page and click Create Account. 
            <br>From here, you must enter in a unique username and valid password. 
            <br>From there, you can access the finance tracker. 
            <br><br>When making your account, you have the option to add an email. You can also add one later. 
            <br>This would be used for security purposes; for example, if you forget your username, you can get an email with your username(s). If you forget your password, you can get an email to reset it. 
            <br>When you first add an email, it will be unverified. To verify it, you would check your email for a verification message when you create the account, or when you click Resend Verification Email in the settings. 
            <br>Verifying your email is optional but is recommended for security purposes.

        <h2 id="initial-balance" class="sectionHeaders">Making an Initial Balance</h2>
        <p>Before using this finance tracker, thereâ€™s a good chance that you already had some savings (or debt). To account for that, you can use the initial balance. The initial balance is initially at $0, but you can change that by clicking Edit. From there, you can enter your actual initial balance. If your balance is negative, do NOT enter a negative sign. Instead, specify that it is negative with the button below the input.</p>

        <h2 id="transaction-categories" class="sectionHeaders">Making Transaction Categories</h2>
        <p>After making an initial balance, the next step is to make transaction categories. These categories provide a way for you to categorize your transactions. There are many ways to do this; some users may want to categorize expenses by want/needs, and others may want to be more specific. You must enter categories before adding transactions.</p>    </div>

        <h2 id="making-transactions" class="sectionHeaders">Making Transactions</h2>
        <p>Once you have made some categories, you can add transactions. For each transaction, you have to specify the type (income or expense), category, name, date, and amount. The date is set to the current date, but you can change this for transactions that you forgot to enter on a previous date, or future transactions if you would like a glimpse into the future. Amounts must be positive - expenses will be handled accordingly.</p>

        <p>Scroll down to the bottom of the finance tracker to see your transactions. You can use the search bar to find them by their name. For each transaction, you can edit or delete it. When editing, ensure that the amount is positive. After you are finished editing or deleting the transaction, the current balance will reflect it.</p>
