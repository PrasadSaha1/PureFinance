        <p>To use the website, you must make an account. If you are not currently logged in, you can go to the home page and click Create Account. 
            <br>From here, you must enter in a unique username and valid password. 
            <br>From there, you can access the finance tracker. By clicking the button on the home page or the link in the header.

            <br><br>When making your account, you have the option to add an email. You can also add one later. 
            <br>This would be used for security purposes; for example, if you forget your username, you can get an email with your username(s). If you forget your password, you can get an email to reset it. 
            <br>When you first add an email, it will be unverified. To verify it, you would check your email for a verification message when you create the account, or when you click Resend Verification Email in the settings. 
            <br>Verifying your email is optional but is recommended for security purposes.

        <p><strong>Why do I need to make an account?</strong>
        <br>PureFinance requires users to make an account to allow access to past data. We will not use your data in any way outside of the website.</p>

        <h2 id="initial-balance" class="sectionHeaders">Making an Initial Balance</h2>
        <p>Before using this finance tracker, there’s a good chance that you already had some savings (or debt). To account for that, you can use the initial balance.
           <br>The initial balance is initially at $0, but you can change that by clicking Edit. From there, you can enter your actual initial balance. 
           <br>If your balance is negative, do NOT enter a negative sign. Instead, specify that it is negative with the button below the input.</p>

        <h3>FAQ</h3>
        <p><strong>What if I have a category that is both an income and an expense?</strong>
        <br>In this case, you can add that category as both an income and an expense. Category names must generally be unique, but duplicates are allowed if they are in different transaction types (income/expense).</p>

    <div class="content">
        <h2 id="transaction-categories" class="sectionHeaders">Making Transaction Categories</h2>
        <p>After making an initial balance, the next step is to make transaction categories. These categories provide a way for you to categorize your transactions. 
            <br>There are many ways to do this; some users may want to categorize expenses by want/needs, and others may want to be more specific. 
            <br>You must enter categories before adding transactions.

        <p>Once you have made some categories, you can add transactions. For each transaction, you have to specify the type (income or expense), category, name, date, and amount. 
            <br>The date is set to the current date, but you can change this for transactions that you forgot to enter on a previous date, or future transactions if you would like a glimpse into the future. 
            <br>Amounts must be positive - expenses will be handled accordingly.

            <br>For each transaction, you can edit or delete it. When editing, ensure that the amount is positive. After you are finished editing or deleting the transaction, the current balance will reflect it.</p>

        <h3>FAQ</h3>
        <p><strong> I’m filtering by date and/or price, but I don’t see anything</strong>
        <br>If you are filtering by date/price and don’t see anything, it means that
        <br>1. Your inputs are invalid (ie. entering a high price of $20 and a low price of $50. The website will inform you when this occurs).
        <br>2. There are no transactions in that range.

    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <h2 id="sorting-filtering" class="sectionHeaders">Sorting and Filtering Transactions</h2>
        <p>To the bottom left are the filtering options. These include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Include Initial Balance</b>: Includes the initial balance when calculating your current balance. Checked by default.</li>
            <li><b>Transaction Type</b>: Choose to see only incomes, only expenses, both, or neither (default: both).</li>
            <li><b>Categories</b>: Specify which categories to view.</li>
            <li><b>Filter by Date</b>: Only include transactions within a date range. Ensure valid dates (e.g., end date is not before the start date).</li>
            <li><b>Filter by Price</b>: Only include transactions within a price range. Expenses are treated as positive values.</li>

    <div class="content">
        <h2 id="viewing-summaries" class="sectionHeaders">Viewing Summaries</h2>
        <p>At the top of the view transactions area, there is a view summaries area. This allows you to view the sum of your transactions at various intervals (weekly, monthly, annually).
            <br> You can also have a custom period. You would have to specify the length (ex. 14 days), and a reference date (ex. 2/16/2025) which would be the start date of one cycle.
            <br> The summaries will be based on the current filters. For example, if you only have incomes selected, the amounts in your summary will only reflect incomes. 
            <br> If the amount is positive for a period, it will be green; if it's negative, it will be red, and there will be a negative sign.
        </p>
          </div>
        <div class="faq">
        <h3>FAQ</h3>
        <p><strong>How can I get an in-depth analysis of one summary period?</strong>
        <br>To achieve that, you can go to view transactions and specify that summary period when filtering by date.    </p>
