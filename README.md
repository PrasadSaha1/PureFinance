Hello! My name is Prasad Saha, and this is my submission for NYS FBLA Coding and Programming 2025. <br>
To view the program, click the link below. This link is also found in the about section of the Github. <br>
https://purefinance.vercel.app/ <br>
If the link is for whatever reason unaccessable, you can view the video of the program, or you can install it on your local machine (both below)

<b>Notes</b> <br> 
The app is currently called PureFinance, but originally, it was MyFinance. This is reflected in some elements of the code (ex. the django app is called my_finance)

This is a work in progress. 
remember to add logo.com to documentation
