<b>Notes</b> 
<br> The app is currently called PureFinance, but originally, it was MyFinance. This is reflected in some elements of the code (ex. the django app is called my_finance)
<br> To view code samples, go to the main folder (or register). From there, templates, static, and templates/main have non pregenerated-code, as well as some of the python files, such as views.py
